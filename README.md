# KalahaGame
A Java implementation of the game Kalaha (Kalah, Warri, Owari, Kalahari).

An executable .jar file can be downloaded at ../KalahaGame/Kalaha/dist/Kalaha.jar.

Done in NetBeans 8.0.2 in 2019 as hobby and to learn more about UI design. I had/have plans on learning more about machine learning through this game, as this is slightly more interesting than simple number recognition.

This is a 2 player game, where the players are trying to collect the most 'seeds' in their 'homes'. The rules are not detailed there - there are a few, and I'm pretty sure others are better at phrasing them. :)

The raw .java files can be found at ../KalahaGame/Kalaha/src/Kalaha. The program itself can be run in two modes: with UI (base setting) and without UI (can be selected only through modifying the code). Without UI, the game can be run repeatedly to test the AI's abilities; with UI, one can play against another player or against an AI.

There is quick access for resetting the game, and an options pane for how the game should run (speed, AI difficulty, who starts) or set up(equal/random distribution of balls in bowls).
